# Online_Book_Store
This project contains an SQL-based Online Bookstore system built using three CSV files: books.csv, customers.csv, and orders.csv. I created corresponding database tables, imported all data, and implemented proper primary and foreign key relationships. The repository also includes 20 SQL queries (11 basic + 9 advanced) to analyze books, customers, and order transactions.
